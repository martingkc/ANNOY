### !! WIP - still not functional: 
### TODOS:

-  Try traverse stacking instead of Parent node pointer.
-  Add binary serialization and deserialization


### REF: 
- [Explanation of the Algorithm by the Spotify Engineer that created it](https://erikbern.com/2015/10/01/nearest-neighbors-and-vector-models-part-2-how-to-search-in-high-dimensional-spaces.html)
